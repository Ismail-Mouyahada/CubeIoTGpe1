Raspberry Pi Weather Station Project
Project Description

This project was undertaken as part of an academic study and aims to create a weather station using a Raspberry Pi. The goal is to collect meteorological data from sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi, process the data, and display it in a user-friendly manner.
Key Features

    Data Acquisition:
        Use sensors such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure sensors to collect meteorological information.

    Data Processing:
        Implement Python scripts on the Raspberry Pi to process collected data, organize it, and store it in a structured manner.

    Data Storage:
        Utilize a database (local or remote) to store meteorological data, allowing for historical analysis.

    User-Friendly Visualization:
        Create a user-friendly interface accessible via a web browser to display real-time meteorological data, graphs, and trends.

    Meteorological Alerts:
        Implement alert mechanisms to notify the user of specific weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures or sudden changes.

Hardware Used

    Raspberry Pi: The central processing unit of the weather station.
    Meteorological Sensors: Temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
    Internet Connection: To retrieve additional information and enable remote access.

Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Primarily Python for sensor management and data processing.
    User Interface: Web interface using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript.
    Database: SQLite or MySQL for storing and managing data.

Educational Objectives

    Understand how meteorological sensors work and integrate them with a Raspberry Pi.
    Acquire Python programming skills for sensor manipulation and data analysis.
    Learn to design a simple user interface for visualizing meteorological data.

This project provides a valuable learning opportunity by combining electronics, programming, and user interface design in the specific context of meteorology.
