# Raspberry Pi Weather Station

## Project Overview

This project, developed as part of an academic study, focuses on creating a weather station using a Raspberry Pi. The aim is to gather meteorological data from various sensors, process it, and present it in an accessible manner.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition:** Utilize sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) to collect meteorological information.
- **Data Processing:** Python scripts on the Raspberry Pi process and organize collected data.
- **Data Storage:** Store meteorological data in a database for historical analysis.
- **User-Friendly Visualization:** A web interface displays real-time data, graphs, and trends.
- **Meteorological Alerts:** Implement alerts for specific weather conditions.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi:** Central processing unit for the weather station.
- **Meteorological Sensors:** Temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
- **Internet Connection:** Enables data retrieval and remote access.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python for sensor management and data processing.
- **User Interface:** HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript for the web interface.
- **Database:** SQLite or MySQL for data storage.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-station.git
   cd weather-station
   ```
